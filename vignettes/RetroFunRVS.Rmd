## General Presentation
RetroFunRVS is a score test permitting the integration of functional annotation within family-based rare-variant association test. Because, we have demonstrated that affected individuals contribute for more information than non-affected ones, we proposed and implemented a burden test. Moreover, one of the critical feature of RetroFunRVS is to consider only affected members among families. Details can be found in Mangnier & Bureau, 2022.
